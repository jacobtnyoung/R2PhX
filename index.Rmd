Welcome to [R 2 Phoenix]()! This site is dedicated to analyzing data from the [City of Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.gov/) open [data](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/) portal.

[City of Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.gov/) open [data](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/) portal? It is a repository for data that the city collects and makes available. As of last check, there were over 50 datasets available. The site is well organized, so I would encourage you to open an new tab and check it out. The site has a [tips](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/pages/tips) page with a good intro to site navigation and how it is maintained.  

*This* site uses the data from the [data portal](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/) to examine various topics (see below). For each topic, there are a set of questions that are examined using data from the portal. **Enjoy!**
